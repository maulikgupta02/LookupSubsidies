                                    The government is considering a plan to set up 1,000-acre mega textile parks as it revamps the Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) whose slow progress is attributed to delay in obtaining land and other statutory clearances from state governments and slow fund mobilisation by the textile parks. Launched in 2005, the scheme aims to provide industry with state-of-the-art world-class infrastructure facilities for setting up their textile units. Each Integrated Textile Park (ITP) under the scheme would normally have 50 units. The number of entrepreneurs and the resultant investments in each ITP could vary from project to project.
                                    Under the SITP, infrastructure facilities for setting up of textile units are developed in a Public-Private- Partnership (PPP) model.
 Eligibility:  Industry Associations, Groups of Entrepreneurs and Agencies of the State Governments would be the main promoters of the Integrated Textile Parks (ITPs). At each ITP, there would be a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed by the representatives of local Industry, Financial Institutions, State industrial and infrastructural corporations, and other agencies of State and Central Governments. The SPV shall invariably be a Corporate Body registered under the Companies Act. The net worth of each promoter should not be less than 1.5 times of his/her total equity proposed in the project. Any other structure for the SPV would require the approval of the Project Approval Committee.
